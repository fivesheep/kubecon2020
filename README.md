## KubeCon 2020 Demo

[NATS](https://nats.io) is a simple, secure and performant communications system 
for digital systems, services and devices. NATS is a hosted project in the 
Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF](https://cncf.io)). NATS has over
[30 client language implementations](https://nats.io/download/), and the NATS Server
can run on-premise, in the cloud, at the edge, and even on a Raspberry Pi. 
NATS can secure and simplify design and operation of modern distributed systems.

Learn how to build applications that span across more than one Kubernetes region by using a NATS based global communications network. 
In this talk, it will be covered how to setup a globally available NATS cluster using multiple Kubernetes regions using NATS gateways and leafnode connections, as well as how to create applications that take advantage of the NATS decentralized authorization model by showing how to implement a simple Slack-like clone that runs under your terminal.
